The JavaImportTool application uses parts of the Apache Commons Framework and the Eclipse JDT. To avoid licensing
issues, the dependencies are not included with Envision. They are available for download on-line and you must agree
to their License and Copyright Agreements before using them:
- http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/
- http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/
- http://eclipse.org/

The .classpath file (typically used by Eclipse) lists all dependencies:
- You will need to manually download the commons-io-2.4.jar and the commons-lang3-3.1.jar into the lib directory. Newer
versions might work too, as long as they provide the same interface. If you use a different version you need to adjust
the .classpath file accordingly.
- The rest of the dependencies come from the Eclipse JDT. You need to adjust the version of each file in
.classpath in order to match what is currently installed by your Eclipse distribution.
